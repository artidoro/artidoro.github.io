### Bio
I am a first-year research master (MLT) student at the Language and Technologies Institute at CMU. I work on machine learning and natural language processing. My advisor is [Yulia Tsvetkov](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ytsvetko/).

Before CMU, I worked at Microsoft AI Frameworks for one year. I studied physics, math and computer science at Harvard where I obtained an AB/SM.
I am Italian and German, and attended a French school in Rome for fifteen years.

### NLP Research
Language and reasoning are intricately related - one is the means through which the other can exist and be expressed. A fascinating aspect about NLP research is that a deeper understanding of language can shed light on human thinking. NLP is also an eminently practical discipline, and advances in tasks such as machine translation have significantly contributed to society. What ultimately motivates me is the hope of going beyond pattern recognition and finding probabilistic models of language that can encode reasoning. How can we build learning models capable of expressing both concepts and their relations? How would we use the additional structure to improve understanding of model decisions for practical applications such as healthcare? Could these structures be transferred to new tasks with marginal task-specific learning required?

### Other Interests
I really enjoy thinking about the relationship between religion and science, superintelligent AI scenarios, and ethical challenges faced by AI.

Machine learning is rapidly transitioning from research to a core element of modern application development. I hope to bring machine learning tools to a wide audience of developers. While at Microsoft, I worked on developing the machine learning library ML<span></span>.NET. For more information see [our KDD paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05715).

I love sports. I am on the CMU fencing club. Previously, I was part of the Harvard Fencing varsity team, and competed internationally in modern pentathlon back in Italy.
