I am a second-year research master (MLT) student at the Language and Technologies Institute at CMU. I work on machine learning and natural language processing. My advisor is [Yulia Tsvetkov](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ytsvetko/). My work is currently funded by the DARPA project [SemaFor](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2019-09-03a). 

Before CMU, I worked at Microsoft AI Frameworks for one year. I studied physics, math and computer science at Harvard where I obtained an AB/SM.
I am Italian and German, and attended a French school in Rome for fifteen years.

### NLP Research
Language and reasoning are intricately related â€“ one is the means through which the other can exist andbe expressed.  A fascinating aspect about NLP research is that a deeper understanding of language can shedlight on human thinking.  What ultimately motivates me is the hope of going beyond pattern recognitionand finding linguistically grounded models of language capable of **understanding**, **reasoning**, and **generating** text as effectively and reliably as humans do. 

#### Factuality in NLP
A major problem in natural language understanding is factuality which involves ensuring whether themeaning  of  a  text  is  consistent  in  a  given  context  (for  example  whether  the  summary  is  consistent  withthe  article). I  decided  to  work  on  factuality  as  it  provides  a  relatively  tractable  and  well  defined  setting to  approach  the  overarching  problem  of  reasoning  and  language  understanding. Current  NLP  methods lack both in ensuring the factual consistency of generated text and detecting factual inconsistencies acrossdocuments. As  text  generation  systems  become  increasingly  more  fluent,  their  practical  utility  is  nowlimited by factual inconsistencies in the generated text,  which can make them unreliable and misleading. Furthermore, improvements in the detection of factual errors can have a tremendous social impact, as forexample in helping identify fake news.

### Other Interests
Machine learning is rapidly transitioning from research to a core element of modern application development. I hope to bring machine learning tools to a wide audience of developers. While at Microsoft, I worked on developing the machine learning library ML<span></span>.NET. For more information see [our KDD paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05715).

I love sports. I am on the CMU fencing club. Previously, I was part of the Harvard Fencing varsity team, and competed internationally in modern pentathlon back in Italy.
