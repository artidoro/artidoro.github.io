I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Washington. I am advised by [Luke Zettlemoyer](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/lsz) and work on various topics in NLP. 
Before UW, I was a master student at the Language and Technologies Institute (LTI) at CMU with [Yulia Tsvetkov](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yuliats/). In 2018, I worked at Microsoft AI Frameworks for a year. I studied physics, math, and computer science at Harvard where I obtained an AB/SM. I am Italian and German, and attended a French school in Rome for fifteen years.

Language and reasoning are intricately related â€“ one is the means through which the other can exist and be expressed.  A fascinating aspect about NLP research is that a deeper understanding of language can shed light on human hinking. What ultimately motivates me is the hope of going beyond pattern recognitionand finding linguistically grounded models of language capable of **understanding**, **reasoning**, and **generating** text as effectively and reliably as humans do. 

In my research, I have developed a [pretraining objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10449) for improved controllability of [summarization systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00576), investigated language models' [reasoning abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05392), and their [factual errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13346), as well as [societal challenge](https://aclanthology.org/2022.coling-1.106/) associated with their use. 

NLP is rapidly transitioning from research to a core element of modern applications. By devising computationally efficient NLP systems, I hope to improve the accessibility of NLP and its environmental impact. I previously worked on bringing machine learning tools to a wide audience of developers while at Microsoft where I worked on an open-source machine learning library [ML<span></span>.NET](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05715).

<!-- ### NLP Research

#### Factuality in NLP
A major problem in natural language understanding is factuality which involves ensuring whether the meaning  of  a  text  is  consistent  in  a  given  context  (for  example  whether  the  summary  is  consistent  withthe  article). I  decided  to  work  on  factuality  as  it  provides  a  relatively  tractable  and  well  defined  setting to  approach  the  overarching  problem  of  reasoning  and  language  understanding. Current  NLP  methods lack both in ensuring the factual consistency of generated text and detecting factual inconsistencies acrossdocuments. As  text  generation  systems  become  increasingly  more  fluent,  their  practical  utility  is  nowlimited by factual inconsistencies in the generated text,  which can make them unreliable and misleading. Furthermore, improvements in the detection of factual errors can have a tremendous social impact, as forexample in helping identify fake news. -->

### Fun


I love sports. I was on the CMU fencing club. Previously, I was part of the Harvard Fencing varsity team, and competed internationally in modern pentathlon back in Italy.
