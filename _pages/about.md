### Bio
I am Italian and German, and attended a French school in Rome for fifteen years. I studied physics, math and computer science at Harvard where I obtained an AB/SM. I am now in the machine learning algorithms and toolkit group at Microsoft. We develop Microsoft's machine learning toolkit [ML.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning) which was recently made open source.

### NLP Research
Language and reasoning are intricately related - one is the means through which the other can exist and be expressed. A fascinating aspect about NLP research is that a deeper understanding of language can shed light on human thinking. NLP is also an eminently practical discipline, and advances in tasks such as machine translation have significantly contributed to society. What ultimately motivates me is the hope of going beyond pattern recognition and finding probabilistic models of language that can encode reasoning. How can we build learning models capable of expressing both concepts and their relations? How would we use the additional structure to improve understanding of model decisions for practical applications such as healthcare? Could these structures be transferred to new tasks with marginal task-specific learning required?

This motivated me to join the [Harvard NLP group](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/) at the beginning of my senior year. The group researches data-driven, probabilistic systems for natural language processing and generation. I appreciated the opportunity to learn about NLP from Professor Rush through an intense year of full immersion in the foundational concepts and techniques to discussing the most recent articles on the latest developments.

### MLNET
Machine learning is rapidly transitioning from research to a core element of modern application development. With my work on ML.NET, I am contributing to bring machine learning tools to a wide audience of developers.

### Other Interests
I really enjoy thinking about the relationship between religion and science and superintelligent AI scenarios.

I love sports. I have most recently gotten into climbing. Previously I was part of the Harvard Fencing varsity team, and competed internationally in modern pentathlon back in Italy.
